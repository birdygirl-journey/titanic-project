#chapter 5 loop (loop meaning repeat and repeat )
#for example i have to repeat 321 number and also 21 time then see example
#i=1
#a="hafsa"#21
#we commomnly use "while" in code
#while i <=20:
#    print("hafsaashir",i,a)#21

#another method of writing the code of ur own choice 1 or infinite time look #21
#for example i want to write number from 1 to 5
#i=5#i is called iterator (variable which help us to do iteration)
#while  i>=1:
     #print(i)
  #  i-=1

#print ("loop is ended")



#pratice question of loop

#   q.1print number from 1 to 100

#c=1
#while c <=100:
#print(c)
 # c+=1

#    q.2 print nm from 100 to 1

#d=100
#while d >=1:#stopping condition
 #   print(d)
  #  d-=1


# q.3 write table of n (n=4)

#e=1
#while e <=10:
 #   print(3*e)
  #  e+=1

#q.4  print element of following list using loop:
#heroes=["batman","thor","iron man"]
#i=0
#while i < len(heroes):
 #   print(heroes[i])
  #  i +=1

# q.5 search the number x in this tuple using loop:

#
#
#
#nums= (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
#x=61
#i=0
#while i < len(nums):
 #   if(nums[i] ==x):
  #      print("found the nums",i)
           #break
   # else:
    #    print("finding...")
    #i+=1


# the also break and continue is used in loop 
# break means sttop
#i=0
#while i <=5:
 #   print(i)
  #  if(i==3 ):
   #     break
    #i+=1
#print("end of loop")

#second is ""continue""

#i=0
#while i<=5:
   # if(i==3):#(for even (i%2 ==0))(for odd (i%2 !=0))
       #continue#(works as skip)
      #print(i)
      # i+=1

    #in this eq mean all number we will get except of 3 which we have write
    #if we want to write odd or even number see #21
